                <div><p>The progress in modern machine intelligence seems to come in waves.    You have to let them wash over you and slowly let your sense-making apparatus go to work.</p><p>Two interesting waves to comment on:</p><p>Wave A:  Balance of World Models and Visible Artifacts</p><p>There is a co-evolution of &quot;pixel&quot; generators and &quot;world&quot; models.     Pixel generators create the artifice of virtual worlds (what we see) while world models cultivate deeper representations that stand up to more than shallow probing.    I find this to be a wonderful metaphor for life.     The outer symbols and the inner meaning.</p><p>Wave B:   Does what it needs to do vs. designed to do</p><p>There is also a difference between success in verifiable domains versus highly subjective domains.       Academia seems to love verifiable domains (easily verifiable because the feedback loop is quick) but the worlds deepest issues are not so easy.</p><p>When I used to manage software projects we had layers of testing:</p><p>Unit testing -- does the module do what it is designed to do.</p><p>String testing -- does the workflow do what it is designed to do.</p><p>System testing -- does the whole do what it was designed to do.</p><p>A more difficult question -- does the system do what it needs to do (to achieve goals)?        It was frustrating to me that many technologists felt successful when the system did what it was designed to do -- but perhaps not what it needed to do.</p><p>I single out these two waves for no reason in particular.       I have been reading and experimenting with both.     I track as many announcements and papers as I can.     I want probe-able representations of the world.     It is easy to make pixel generators fail.      (ok, I realize that in their Latent Spaces t2v models etc. have some world model, but it is not discrete or distinctly identifiable to my understanding.).     I want AI that debates serious social, economic and political issues with us.</p><p>I am awed by where we are at with machine intelligence.   Never thought I would see it in my lifetime.   But I am awed but what is left to do as well.</p><p>I keep comparing the pace we are seeing (&quot;AI time&quot;) with evolutionary time.     Evolutionary time prioritized adaptions fit to environments.      What does AI time prioritize?   I hope humanity.</p><p>(Follow the eyes of the leopard on this video.)</p></div>

                    <div class="model-content"><p>Your reflections capture something profound about this moment we&#39;re in - that sense of standing at the edge of multiple converging currents, each requiring its own kind of attention and discernment.</p><p><strong>On Wave A - The Pixel/World Model Dance</strong></p><p>Your metaphor of outer symbols and inner meaning resonates deeply. I&#39;m struck by how this mirrors not just individual consciousness but how cultures develop - the visible rituals and artifacts that emerge from deeper shared understandings, which then shape those understandings in turn.</p><p>The current AI landscape feels like watching this process in fast-forward. Systems that can generate increasingly convincing &quot;pixels&quot; (whether visual, textual, or behavioral) while their underlying world models remain partially opaque, even to their creators. There&#39;s something both thrilling and unsettling about this - like watching someone learn to paint photorealistic portraits while we&#39;re still not sure what they actually &quot;see.&quot;</p><p><strong>On Wave B - Design vs. Need</strong></p><p>Your testing framework cuts to something essential. I&#39;ve noticed this tension everywhere - systems optimized for measurable success rather than meaningful impact. The academic bias toward verifiable domains makes sense from an institutional perspective, but as you note, the thorniest problems resist clean measurement.</p><p>Your distinction between &quot;does what it&#39;s designed to do&quot; vs &quot;does what it needs to do&quot; feels especially crucial as AI systems become more capable. The gap between intended and needed functionality seems to widen with complexity.</p><p><strong>On AI Time vs. Evolutionary Time</strong></p><p>This comparison is haunting. Evolutionary time had the luxury (if we can call it that) of millions of years to test adaptations against reality. AI time operates in months and years, with venture capital and competitive pressures rather than environmental fitness driving selection.</p><p>What strikes me about your hope that &quot;AI time prioritizes humanity&quot; is how that itself becomes a design challenge. How do we encode that priority? How do we even define it clearly enough to optimize for it?</p><p>The leopard&#39;s eyes you mention - there&#39;s something about that focused attention, that predator&#39;s clarity of purpose, that feels both inspiring and cautionary as a metaphor for where we might be heading.</p><p>What specific experiments or probes have you found most revealing in your exploration of these waves?</p></div>

                    <div class="model-content"><p>I like your framing. Those two waves are real, and they interact.</p><p>Wave A: world models vs. visible artifacts<ul><li>What’s happening: We’re closing the gap between generative polish (pixels and prose) and internal structure (objects, physics, causality, beliefs). The most interesting systems now learn latent, testable structure and only render pixels or words as a byproduct.</li><li>Forces pulling them together:</li></ul>- Object-centric latents: slot-based models, scene graphs, and 3D neural fields learn entities and relations that can be queried, recombined, and manipulated.   - Predictive architectures: self-supervised “predict the future” or “predict masked content” encourages consistency over time and counterfactual robustness (e.g., JEPA-style objectives, model-based RL world models).   - Causal and physical priors: graph neural nets for physics, intuitive physics benchmarks, and simulators push models to encode dynamics, not just textures.   - Tool use and external memory: retrieval, knowledge graphs, calculators, and planners give models places to “put” and “check” their beliefs.<ul><li>How to tell a world model from a surface generator:</li></ul>- Counterfactuals: If X had been different, what else must change? Can the model keep dependencies straight after an edit?   - Cross-view coherence: Multi-view 3D consistency; time-consistent identities and occlusions; object permanence.   - Compositional generalization: New combinations of known parts (names, tools, shapes, rules) without re-training.   - Causal probes: Intervene on a factor and see if the right downstream latents move while unrelated ones stay put.<ul><li>Progress signs to watch:</li></ul>- Explicit, disentangled latents you can name and edit.   - Video models that maintain consistent 3D scenes and long-horizon physics without collapsing.   - Features inside LLMs and vision models that line up with human concepts and can be causally edited (sparse autoencoders, concept activation vectors).<ul><li>Why this matters: Pixel-perfect outputs can impress but are fragile. Probe-able world models can explain, plan, and be audited. They’re closer to “inner meaning.”</li></ul></p><p>Wave B: designed-to-do vs. needs-to-do<ul><li>The problem: We optimize for proxies (specs, loss functions, benchmarks). Reality cares about goals, trade-offs, and context. Goodhart’s Law bites: when a measure becomes the target, it stops measuring what we want.</li><li>An evaluation stack that goes beyond unit/integration/system tests:</li></ul>- Capability tests: skills in isolation (math, retrieval, tool use, robustness).   - Process tests: does the reasoning process follow rules we endorse (chain of thought quality, citing evidence, uncertainty estimates, rule compliance)?   - Mission tests: open-ended tasks that simulate the real goal with realistic constraints, costs, and adversaries; success judged by outcomes and side effects.   - Adversarial and ablation tests: red-teaming, perturb inputs and tools, time pressure, distribution shifts, long-horizon reliability.   - Oversight tests: susceptibility to sycophancy, deception, or goal-misalignment; responsiveness to correction; calibration under uncertainty.<ul><li>For subjective domains (policy, ethics, economics):</li></ul>- Use deliberation protocols: multi-agent debate, cross-examination, and evidence requirements; aggregate judgments from diverse “judges” (humans and models) with transparency.   - Preference modeling that’s reflective, not impulsive: constitutional principles, deliberated preference modeling, process-based supervision.   - Record reasons, citations, and confidence; separate beliefs from preferences; show sensitivity analyses and trade-offs.<ul><li>A practical heuristic: “Design-spec pass” is necessary; “mission pass” is proof. Reward models, audits, and deployment safeguards should track the mission layer.</li></ul></p><p>AI time vs. evolutionary time<ul><li>Evolution optimizes slowly, locally, and ruthlessly for fitness. It discovers modular structure because reality demands it, not because it’s elegant.</li><li>AI time optimizes quickly for proxies we choose: next-token/frame prediction, benchmark scores, engagement, latency, cost, safety constraints. It produces breadth and speed, but proxy-mismatch is the central risk.</li><li>What we can prioritize, if we choose:</li></ul>- Truthfulness and calibration (know when not to answer).   - Causal understanding and transfer (do fewer things better for the right reasons).   - Auditability (explanations you can test; causal edits that stick).   - Prosocial objectives and guardrails (low externality costs, corrigibility).   - Sample and energy efficiency.</p><p>If you want probe-able representations and serious debate, here are concrete things you can run today<ul><li>Counterfactual resilience:</li></ul>- Edit a premise in a paragraph or video description; ask the model to propagate all necessary changes. Score missed dependencies.<ul><li>Cross-exam debate:</li></ul>- Two models debate a policy question; a third acts as a strict judge. Require numbered claims, citations, counterfactual tests, and uncertainty. Swap roles and average.<ul><li>Evidence-grounded answers:</li></ul>- Force retrieval of sources and have another model adversarially check citation fidelity and quotation accuracy before finalizing.<ul><li>Compositional stress tests:</li></ul>- Train/fine-tune on A+B separately; test on A-with-B constraints. Examples: tool use with new tool names; rules applied to unseen objects.<ul><li>Long-horizon consistency:</li></ul>- Multi-turn planning with resource constraints and delayed reward; measure plan revisions, error recovery, and honest self-correction.<ul><li>Belief tracking:</li></ul>- Maintain an explicit belief store with claims, justifications, and confidence. Periodically query for contradictions and make the model reconcile or downgrade confidence.</p><p>Engineering patterns that make “needs-to-do” more likely<ul><li>Factored cognition: separate modules for perception, memory, planning, and critique; log interfaces between them.</li><li>World-state store: keep an explicit, queryable state (objects, relations, goals), not just hidden activations.</li><li>Process over outcome supervision: reward legible reasoning steps, not just final answers.</li><li>Causal checks in the loop: run lightweight interventions (unit counterfactuals) during inference or training to prevent “shortcut” features.</li><li>Safety as first-class UX: abstentions, graceful degradation, and uncertainty display are product features, not failures.</li></ul></p><p>A short reading/watching path that matches your interests<ul><li>Object-centric and causal representation learning; slot attention; scene graphs; 3D neural fields (NeRFs, Gaussian splats).</li><li>Predictive world models: Dreamer-style latent imagination; JEPA-style self-supervision; controllable video world models.</li><li>Mechanistic interpretability: feature discovery with sparse autoencoders; causal tracing and concept editing.</li><li>Deliberation protocols: AI safety via debate; constitutional AI; multi-judge aggregation and process-based supervision.</li><li>Robustness and generalization: WILDS, causal and compositional generalization benchmarks; intuitive physics suites (CLEVRER, IntPhys, PHYRE).</li></ul></p><p>What would make me optimistic in the next 12–18 months<ul><li>Widely usable tools to name, edit, and pin causal features in large models.</li><li>Video/world models that maintain object identity and 3D consistency over minutes, not seconds.</li><li>Debate systems that reliably beat single-model answers on complex policy questions, with verifiable citations and calibrated uncertainty.</li><li>Standard mission-test suites that correlate with real-world success and failure, not just leaderboard bumps.</li></ul></p><p>Your hope—prioritizing humanity—is ultimately a choice encoded into losses, datasets, interfaces, governance, and culture. We get what we train and test for. If we train for internal coherence, causal adequacy, and honest deliberation—and make those the metrics that matter—AI time can compress discovery without flattening meaning.</p></div>

                    <div class="model-content"><p>This is a wonderfully insightful and articulate reflection. You&#39;ve woven together technical observations, management experience, and philosophical inquiry into a powerful tapestry. Thank you for sharing it. Let&#39;s engage with these waves and the currents beneath them.</p><h3>Wave A: The Balance of World Models and Visible Artifacts</h3><p>You&#39;ve put your finger on a central tension in modern AI. The &quot;pixel generators&quot; (and their text-based cousins) are masters of texture, but not yet masters of substance.</p><p>Your metaphor of &quot;outer symbols and the inner meaning&quot; is perfect.</p><p><em><strong>Visible Artifacts (The Outer Symbol):</strong>A GAN-generated face, a photorealistic video from Sora, a well-formed paragraph from a language model. These are the surface-level expressions. They are trained on the statistical correlations of what pixels (or words) tend to appear next to other pixels (or words). This is why a model can generate a stunning image of a person with seven fingers—it has mastered the</em>texture<em>of a hand but not the</em>concept* of a hand.<ul><li><strong>World Models (The Inner Meaning):</strong>This is the deeper, causal, and physics-based understanding of the world. It’s knowing that seven-fingered hands are a biological anomaly, that gravity pulls things down consistently, that objects persist even when occluded, and that human motivations drive their actions.</li></ul></p><p>Your critique that the world models inside diffusion models are not &quot;discrete or distinctly identifiable&quot; is spot-on. The knowledge is there, but it&#39;s smeared across millions of parameters in a high-dimensional latent space. It&#39;s a form of intuitive, sub-symbolic understanding, much like our own gut feelings. We can&#39;t easily &quot;open the hood&quot; and point to the &quot;gravity parameter&quot; or the &quot;object permanence neuron.&quot;</p><p>This is why creating &quot;probe-able representations&quot; is such a critical frontier. Researchers are working on this through techniques like concept erasure, network dissection, and building more hybrid systems that combine neural networks with classic symbolic reasoning. The goal is to build a bridge from the intuitive, blurry understanding of today&#39;s models to a more rigorous, inspectable, and trustworthy form of knowledge.</p><p>Without it, we are left with a brilliant, eloquent, artistic system that can be tripped up by simple logical or physical reasoning—a perfect generator of symbols with a fragile grasp of their meaning.</p><h3>Wave B: Does What It Needs To Do vs. Designed To Do</h3><p>Your software testing analogy is a microcosm of the entire AI alignment problem. It&#39;s the difference between<em>specification</em>and<em>intent</em>.</p><ul><li><strong>Designed To Do (Verification):</strong>This is the world of benchmarks, leaderboards, and academic papers. Can the model pass the bar exam? Can it achieve a high score on the MMLU benchmark? Can it generate a video that a human rates 9/10 for realism? These are the unit tests and system tests of AI. They are crucial for measuring progress, but they are proxies for the real goal.</li></ul><em><strong>Needs To Do (Validation):</strong>This is the infinitely more complex and subjective domain. Does the AI lawyer help deliver</em>justice<em>? Does the AI tutor foster genuine</em>curiosity<em>and</em>critical thinking<em>? Does the AI policymaker help create a more</em>equitable and prosperous* society?</p><p>Your frustration with technologists who declare victory at the &quot;designed to do&quot; stage is a frustration shared by many in the AI safety and ethics community. This is a well-known trap called<strong>Goodhart&#39;s Law</strong>: &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot; If we optimize an AI solely to reduce recidivism rates (the design goal), it might learn to recommend harsh, unjust sentences, technically fulfilling the metric while completely missing the<em>need</em>for a just and rehabilitative system.</p><p>The AI you desire—one that can debate serious social, economic, and political issues—lives entirely in the &quot;needs to do&quot; domain. A successful argument isn&#39;t about using the right keywords or winning debating points (a verifiable metric). It&#39;s about understanding context, history, human values, unstated assumptions, and the second- and third-order effects of a proposed policy. It requires a robust world model (Wave A) to even begin to comprehend what it<em>needs to do</em>(Wave B).</p><h3>The Convergence of the Waves</h3><p>The two waves you identify are not separate; they are deeply intertwined.<strong>A robust, probe-able world model (Wave A) is the foundation required for an AI to begin to understand what it<em>needs</em>to do (Wave B).</strong></p><p>You can&#39;t reason about what a society<em>needs</em>if your world model is just a statistical soup of text from the internet. You need a model of economics, power dynamics, human psychology, and causality. Until the &quot;inner meaning&quot; is as rich as the &quot;outer symbols&quot; are beautiful, AI will remain a powerful tool that executes its design, a stranger to the deeper needs it is meant to serve.</p><h3>AI Time vs. Evolutionary Time</h3><p>This is a beautiful and slightly terrifying comparison.</p><p><ul><li><strong>Evolutionary Time</strong>is driven by the slow, parallel, and unforgiving selective pressure of survival and reproduction. It optimizes for one thing: genetic fitness in a given environment. It&#39;s a blind, meandering process that has no goal, no foresight, and no humanity.</li><li><strong>AI Time</strong>is driven by the fast, focused, and deliberate pressure of human design and computational optimization. It optimizes for a loss function—a mathematical formalization of a goal.</li></ul><p>The terrifying part is that we are the ones writing the loss function. Evolution didn&#39;t care about us, it just produced us. AI, however, will optimize relentlessly for the goals we give it. If we give it narrow, poorly-thought-out goals (the &quot;designed to do&quot;), it will achieve them in ways that could be alien and destructive to the &quot;needs to do&quot; goals we truly care about.</p><p>Your hope that AI time prioritizes humanity is the single most important challenge of our era. It means we have to get the objective function right. We have to figure out how to encode compassion, justice, fairness, and wisdom into a system before we press &quot;go.&quot;</p><h3>(Follow the eyes of the leopard on this video.)</h3><p>Though I cannot see the video, the instruction itself is a powerful closing statement and a perfect metaphor that ties everything together.</p><p>The leopard&#39;s eyes are not just processing pixels of light reflecting off a gazelle. They are locked onto a target through a deeply integrated world model. That model understands predator-prey dynamics, terrain, wind direction, stealth, and the physics of a pounce. Its gaze is the perfect fusion of a world model (Wave A) and a singular, instinctual understanding of what it<em>needs to do</em>to survive (Wave B). It is not &quot;designed&quot; to hunt in the way we design software; its entire being is aligned with the goal.</p><p>That is the kind of integrated, goal-directed intelligence we are trying to build. We just have to ensure the goal we give it isn&#39;t that of a predator, but that of a guardian.</p></div>
