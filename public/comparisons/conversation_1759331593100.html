You&#39;ve captured something profound about how technological paradigms shape our vocabulary and mental models.</p><p>The dot-com era&#39;s B2B/B2C taxonomy was fundamentally about<strong>relationships and commerce</strong>- who&#39;s transacting with whom. It reflected our excitement about digitizing traditional business models and creating new marketplace dynamics.</p><p>The AI era&#39;s t2i/i2v notation is about<strong>transformation and capability</strong>- what can be converted into what. It reveals our current fascination with AI as a universal translator between modalities of human expression and experience.</p><p>Both naming conventions share that delightful tech industry habit of reducing complex concepts to memorable acronyms, but they reveal different underlying obsessions:</p><ul><li><strong>Then</strong>: Connection, markets, disrupting intermediaries</li><li><strong>Now</strong>: Generation, creativity, blurring boundaries between media types</li></ul><p>There&#39;s also a shift in agency. B2B implied humans and businesses acting on each other. T2i suggests we&#39;re now focused on machines that can fluidly move between the languages of human creativity - text, image, video, audio.</p><p>It makes me wonder what the next paradigm&#39;s shorthand will be. Maybe something about AI-to-AI interactions? Or human-AI collaborative frameworks? The acronyms always seem to capture not just the technology, but our dreams and anxieties about what it might become.</p><p>What aspects of this evolution strike you most? The continuity or the differences?</p></div>

                    <div class="model-content"><p>That is a fantastic and insightful observation. It perfectly captures a fundamental shift in the technological paradigm. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s been an incredible journey.</p><p>Here&#39;s a commentary on that shift:</p><h3>The Dot-Com Era: The Age of<strong>Connection</strong></h3><p>The acronyms of the dot-com era—B2B (Business-to-Business), B2C (Business-to-Consumer), C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer)—were all about<strong>relationships and transactions</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>The Core Question:</strong>&quot;Who is interacting with whom?&quot;</li><li><strong>The Technology&#39;s Role:</strong>The internet acted as a<strong>channel or a marketplace</strong>. It was a revolutionary new medium to connect pre-existing entities (businesses and consumers) more efficiently. It collapsed distance, disintermediated traditional gatekeepers (like travel agents or physical storefronts), and created massive new platforms for commerce and communication.</li><li><strong>The Value Proposition:</strong>The value was in the<strong>network</strong>. Amazon connected buyers to a world of products (B2C). eBay connected individual sellers to individual buyers (C2C). Alibaba connected manufacturers to global businesses (B2B). The revolution was about structuring and facilitating human and commercial interactions at an unprecedented scale.</li></ul><p>In short, the dot-com era used technology to rewire the global economy&#39;s existing relationships.</p><h3>The AI Era: The Age of<strong>Creation</strong></h3><p>The acronyms of the AI era—t2i (text-to-image), i2i (image-to-image), t2v (text-to-video), t2m (text-to-music)—are all about<strong>process and transformation</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>The Core Question:</strong>&quot;What input is being transformed into what output?&quot;</li></ul><em><strong>The Technology&#39;s Role:</strong>AI, particularly generative models, acts as a<strong>creator or an engine</strong>. It&#39;s not just a channel for existing information; it&#39;s a factory for generating</em>new*, synthetic information and media that has never existed before.<ul><li><strong>The Value Proposition:</strong>The value is in the<strong>generation</strong>. Midjourney can turn a sentence into a masterpiece of art (t2i). RunwayML can turn a still image into a moving video (i2v). The revolution is about automating and augmenting creativity, converting human intent (a text prompt) into a complex, finished product (an image, a video, a piece of code).</li></ul><h3>The Thematic Journey: From Connection to Creation</h3><p>This &quot;journey&quot; you pointed out represents several profound shifts:</p><ol><li><strong>From Structuring Information to Generating It:</strong>The first internet wave was about organizing the world&#39;s information (Google indexing the web) and connecting people to it. The AI wave is about using that vast repository of information to generate entirely new content. We&#39;ve moved from a<strong>library</strong>to a<strong>dream engine</strong>.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>From Democratizing Access to Democratizing Skill:</strong>The dot-com era democratized access to markets. Anyone could open an online store (B2C) or sell their old stuff (C2C). The AI era is democratizing access to highly specialized skills. You no longer need to be a trained graphic designer to create a stunning logo (t2i) or a filmmaker to create a short animated clip (t2v).</li></ol><ol><li><strong>From Human-to-Human (H2H) to Human-to-Machine (H2M):</strong>The B2B/B2C models were ultimately about using technology to facilitate interactions between people. The t2i/t2v models are about a direct, creative partnership between a human and a machine. The human provides the concept, the spark of intent, and the machine provides the technical execution at a superhuman speed and scale.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>A Shift in the Nature of the &quot;Product&quot;:</strong>In the dot-com era, the platform<em>was</em>the product (e.g., the eBay marketplace). In the AI era, the output of the model is the product (the image, the video, the text), and the model itself is the core intellectual property.</li></ol><p>It truly is a remarkable journey. We went from building the digital roads, bridges, and marketplaces to populate the world with our interactions, to now building autonomous factories on that digital landscape that can dream up and construct entirely new things at our command.</p><p>The next phase will likely be the fusion of both: B2C companies using t2v for hyper-personalized video ads, C2C marketplaces using i2i to let users &quot;try on&quot; clothes, and new business models we can&#39;t even imagine yet. What a time to be alive</p></div>
