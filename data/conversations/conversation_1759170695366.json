          "content": "# Flash Attention: Memory-Efficient Attention Algorithm\n\nFlash Attention is an algorithm that computes exact attention with dramatically reduced memory usage by leveraging **tiling** and **recomputation**. Let me break down the core algorithm:\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nStandard attention computation:\n```\nAttention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T)V\n```\n\nThe naive approach requires storing the full attention matrix `QK^T` in memory, which scales as O(N²) where N is sequence length.\n\n## Key Algorithmic Insights\n\n### 1. **Tiling Strategy**\nInstead of computing the full N×N attention matrix, Flash Attention divides the computation into smaller blocks:\n\n- Split Q into blocks of size [Br, d] \n- Split K,V into blocks of size [Bc, d]\n- Process blocks sequentially, keeping only small tiles in fast memory (SRAM)\n\n### 2. **Online Softmax with Rescaling**\nThe critical innovation is computing softmax incrementally across blocks:\n\n```python\n# Simplified Flash Attention inner loop\nfor each block j of K,V:\n    # Compute attention scores for current block\n    S_ij = Q_i @ K_j.T  # [Br, Bc]\n    \n    # Update running max (for numerical stability)\n    m_new = max(m_old, rowmax(S_ij))\n    \n    # Rescale previous output and normalizer\n    O_i = O_i * exp(m_old - m_new)\n    l_i = l_i * exp(m_old - m_new)\n    \n    # Add contribution from current block\n    O_i += exp(S_ij - m_new) @ V_j\n    l_i += rowsum(exp(S_ij - m_new))\n    \n    m_old = m_new\n```\n\n### 3. **The Complete Algorithm**\n\n**Forward Pass:**\n1. Initialize output O = 0, running sum l = 0, running max m = -∞\n2. For each block of Q:\n   - Load Q block into SRAM\n   - For each block of K,V:\n     - Load K,V blocks into SRAM\n     - Compute local attention scores\n     - Update global statistics (m, l) and output (O)\n     - Store updated statistics\n3. Final normalization: O = O / l\n\n**Backward Pass:**\n- Uses similar tiling strategy\n- Recomputes attention scores from stored statistics\n- Avoids storing the full attention matrix\n\n## Memory Complexity\n\n- **Standard Attention**: O(N² + Nd) memory\n- **Flash Attention**: O(N) memory for the attention computation\n- Achieves this while maintaining **exact** attention computation (no approximation)\n\n## Why It Works\n\n1. **SRAM vs HBM Trade-off**: Repeatedly loads data from slow memory (HBM) to fast memory (SRAM), but the cost is amortized by avoiding the O(N²) memory bottleneck\n\n2. **Mathematical Equivalence**: The online softmax algorithm produces identical results to computing the full softmax, just in a different order\n\n3. **Hardware Awareness**: Designed specifically for GPU memory hierarchy - keeps working set small enough for SRAM\n\nThe algorithm is particularly effective for long sequences where the O(N²) memory requirement of standard attention becomes prohibitive.",

          "content": "FlashAttention is an exact attention algorithm that keeps the math the same as standard dot-product attention, but reorganizes the computation to minimize slow memory traffic. It avoids ever materializing the N×N attention matrix by streaming over K/V in tiles and doing an “online softmax” per query row. The result is O(N^2) compute as usual, but O(N) extra memory and far fewer reads/writes to high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is why it’s much faster on GPUs.\n\nKey idea in one sentence:\n- Tile Q/K/V so that a block of Q and one block of K/V fit in on-chip SRAM; for each Q row, keep running softmax statistics (row max and normalization) and a running weighted sum of V, updating them as you stream through K/V tiles; normalize once at the end.\n\nSet-up and notation:\n- Inputs: Q ∈ R^{N×d}, K ∈ R^{N×d}, V ∈ R^{N×d_v}; scale factor s = 1/sqrt(d).\n- Goal: O = softmax(QK^T · s) V.\n- Hardware: HBM (global memory) is slow; SRAM/shared memory and registers are fast but small.\n\nCore algorithm (single head; batching/heads just add outer loops):\n1) Tile shapes\n   - Choose a query tile size Br (rows) and a key/value tile size Bc (cols) so Q_tile ∈ R^{Br×d}, K_tile ∈ R^{Bc×d}, V_tile ∈ R^{Bc×d_v} fit in SRAM.\n   - Load one Q tile and keep it resident; stream over all K/V tiles.\n\n2) Per-query running state (held in registers/SMEM, in FP32 for stability)\n   - m ∈ R^{Br}: running row-wise max of logits (per query row).\n   - l ∈ R^{Br}: running row-wise sum of exp(logits − m) (the softmax denominator in a stable form).\n   - o ∈ R^{Br×d_v}: running unnormalized output sum, Σ_j exp(logit_ij − m_i) V_j.\n\n   Initialize: m = −∞, l = 0, o = 0.\n\n3) Sweep over K/V tiles\n   For each K/V tile:\n   - Load K_tile, V_tile into SRAM.\n   - Compute S = (Q_tile · K_tile^T) · s using tensor cores (matrix multiply).\n   - Apply mask if needed (e.g., causal: set S_ij = −∞ where j > i).\n   - Row-wise for each query r in the tile:\n     • m_blk = max_j S[r, j] over the current tile.\n     • m_new = max(m[r], m_blk)                  [new global max for the row]\n     • α = exp(m[r] − m_new)                     [rescale factor for previous partial sums]\n     • Compute exp terms relative to m_new:\n         - E[r, j] = exp(S[r, j] − m_new)\n         - l_new = α · l[r] + Σ_j E[r, j]\n         - v_sum = Σ_j E[r, j] · V_tile[j, :]\n         - o_new = α · o[r, :] + v_sum\n     • Update state: m[r] = m_new, l[r] = l_new, o[r, :] = o_new\n\n4) Finalize the tile\n   - After all K/V tiles are processed: Output_tile[r, :] = o[r, :] / l[r]  (row-wise division).\n\nWhy this is exact (online softmax):\n- Softmax over concatenated blocks can be computed incrementally using the log-sum-exp trick:\n  If you have partial sums computed with max m_old and new block with max m_blk, then with m_new = max(m_old, m_blk):\n    l_new = e^{m_old−m_new} l_old + Σ e^{S_blk−m_new}\n    o_new = e^{m_old−m_new} o_old + Σ e^{S_blk−m_new} V_blk\n  This maintains exact softmax normalization without ever storing the full attention matrix.\n\nHow masking and dropout fit:\n- Causal masking: for a Q tile covering rows [r0, r0+Br), only multiply with K/V tiles whose column range doesn’t exceed the causal boundary; inside a tile, set invalid S entries to −∞ before exponentiation.\n- Dropout: generate a RNG mask per score (or per block) on the fly; multiply E[r, j] by dropout_mask/keep_prob before accumulating v_sum and l_new. No extra memory needed.\n\nNumerical considerations:\n- Compute S, accumulators l and o in FP32; inputs often in FP16/BF16. The rescaling via m_new prevents overflow/underflow.\n- The final division o/l is also done in FP32, and then cast back if needed.\n\nPerformance logic (why it’s fast):\n- The naive implementation materializes A = softmax(QK^T), which is N×N and forces O(N^2) HBM traffic. FlashAttention never writes A and reads each K/V tile once per Q tile while keeping Q in SRAM, turning the bottleneck from memory-bound to compute-bound.\n- Complexity: same O(N^2 d) FLOPs, but memory traffic drops from O(N^2) to roughly O(N d + N d_v) plus tile-sized working sets.\n- Kernel fuses: QK^T, masking, softmax, dropout, and AV all in one pass.\n\nHigh-level pseudocode (per head):\nfor q_block in blocks_of_rows(N, Br):\n  Q_tile = load(Q[q_block, :])        // to SRAM\n  m = fill(Br, -inf); l = 0; o = 0    // FP32\n  for kv_block in blocks_of_rows(N, Bc):\n    K_tile = load(K[kv_block, :])     // to SRAM\n    V_tile = load(V[kv_block, :])     // to SRAM\n    S = (Q_tile @ K_tile^T) * s       // tensor cores\n    apply_mask_in_place(S)\n    // row-wise update\n    m_blk = rowmax(S)\n    m_new = max(m, m_blk)\n    alpha = exp(m - m_new)\n    E = exp(S - m_new[:, None])\n    if dropout: E *= dropout_mask / p_keep\n    l = alpha * l + rowsum(E)\n    o = alpha[:, None] * o + E @ V_tile\n    m = m_new\n  O[q_block, :] = o / l[:, None]\n\nWhat FlashAttention-2/3 change (brief):\n- Same mathematics and online-softmax invariants. They improve GPU utilization:\n  - More parallelism by splitting the K/V sweep across thread blocks and reducing partial results.\n  - Better pipelining of global→shared loads (cp.async), vectorization, and tensor-core scheduling.\n  - Support for longer sequences, mixed head dims, and higher throughput on newer architectures.\n  - Still exact, still no attention matrix materialization.\n\nBig picture:\n- FlashAttention is an IO-aware, tiled, fused kernel for exact attention that hinges on the online softmax update. The core state per query row is just three things: the running max m, the running sum l, and the running weighted value o; stream tiles of K/V, update these, and normalize once at the end.",
